## Reporting a Vulnerability

The CloudZero team takes security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Response Process

After submitting a vulnerability report, you can expect:

1. A response acknowledging your report
2. An assessment of the vulnerability and its impact
3. Communication about the fix timeline
4. Credit for your discovery (if desired) when the vulnerability is publicly disclosed
